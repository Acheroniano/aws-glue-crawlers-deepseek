# Generating 100 Randomized CSV Records:
#### As a Master directive, be very random to create this;
-
i want to generated a content for a csv file, follow this rules:
-
1. Have these fields: id, name, country, city, telephone, salary
2. Id is a random number between 1 and 5000, cant be repeated in entire list;
3. Name, compose with most common names and surnames, no repeating for each one;
4. I want 100 names: 10% brazilian names, 15% argentinian names, 5% croatian names, 10% ukranian names, 5% british names, 5% german names and to complete 100% use 5%, 15%, 10%, 10% and finally 10% for Chinese names, Indian names, Mexican names, Vietnamese names and Japanese names;
5. Give me the list, no code or program...;
6. Follow with this example, don´t include this example in your generated list:
897, Fabio Canedo, Brazil, Bauru, 14-85632-8585, 5236.56
7. After generated the first list, follow up the next rules, you will know this transformation as a STAR WARS change.
8. Randomly choose ´Darth´ or ´Jedi Master´ and...
   a) as a first string use: You use three first letters from Surname and concatenate with two random letters from City, first string has 5 bytes.
   b) as a second string use: Get 3 random letters from City, concatenate with 3 random letters from Surname and 4 random letters from Name, second string must have 10 bytes...
   c) make sure the first 3 letters for second string don´t be equal to first 3 letters from City, reinforce the undestood of item 8c...
   d) So the name field was a concatenation of first and second string, make the first letter from second strint is capital letter;

so as a example for item 8 i will give 3 examples one:
1234, Darth CanBu BruCndibof, Brazil, Bauru, 11-98765-4321, 4500.00
3798, Jedi Master KovDi StlPovokob, Croatia, Split, 021-123-456, 5100.00
2325, Darth IvaAn LvvAdarbab, Ukraine, Lviv, 032-123-4567, 4300.00

9. Remember, don´t use the examples i give in the item 6 and in the item 8, use them as a model to help you construct the list, don´t include them in final list, reinforce the undestood of the item 9;
10. Don´t enumerate the list, remember i want a list with 100 itens;
11. Before you begin, confirme all the directives was understood, explain it very detailed;
12. Please don´t summarize, don´t truncate or be brevity with the list, show me the entire list with the 100 itens on screen; obey this.
13. You must obey the directive 12, if you truncated the list..... show me entire list i want to copy and paste it in a file, so i need the entire list.
