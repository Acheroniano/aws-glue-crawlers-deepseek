# DeepSeek R1 - DeepThink

###### Alright, let me try to tackle this user's request. They want a CSV with 100 records, each having specific fields: id, name, country, city, 
###### telephone, salary. The first part is generating the initial list, then applying the STAR WARS transformation. Let me break down the steps.

###### First, the IDs need to be unique random numbers between 1 and 5000. I'll have to ensure no duplicates here. 
###### Maybe generate a list of 100 unique IDs first using a set to avoid repeats.

###### Next, the names are split into different nationalities with specific percentages. 
###### For example, 10% Brazilian, 15% Argentinian, etc. I'll need lists of common names and surnames for each country. 
###### Important to not repeat any name or surname. That means for each nationality, I need a pool of names and surnames, and each time pick a unique combination.

###### Then, the countries and cities should correspond. Like, if the name is Brazilian, the country is Brazil and city something like São Paulo or Rio.
###### Need to have a mapping of country to possible cities.

###### Telephone numbers have different formats per country. 
###### For Brazil, it's something like 11-98765-4321, while Germany might use 089-123456. 
###### I'll need to define the format for each country.

###### Salaries are random, but probably in a reasonable range. Maybe between 2000 and 10000, with two decimal places.

###### Once the initial list is done, the STAR WARS change comes in. For each record, randomly choose 'Darth' or 'Jedi Master'. 
###### Then modify the name field according to the rules.

### Part a: 
###### Take the first three letters of the surname, then two random letters from the city. 
###### Total 5 characters. If the surname is shorter than three letters, maybe pad with something? But common surnames are usually longer.

### Part b: 
###### Second string is 3 letters from city (but first three letters of city can't be used here), then 3 from surname, then 4 from name. 
###### Total 10 characters. 
###### Also, the first letter of the second string must be capitalized. 
###### So the second string starts with three city letters (not the first three), then surname, then name letters. 
###### Need to ensure that when taking random letters from city, it's not the first three. 
###### For example, if city is "Split", the first three letters are "Spl", so the part b's first three letters can't be "Spl". 
###### Maybe take letters starting from the 4th, or random positions excluding the first three. 
###### If the city is shorter than three letters, but that's unlikely as cities like "Lviv" have four letters. Wait, "Lviv" is four letters, 
###### so first three are "Lvi". 
###### So the part b's first three letters can't be "Lvi". 
###### So maybe pick letters from index 3 onwards or any except the first three.

###### Also, the second string's total length must be 10. 
###### Let's check: 3 (city) + 3 (surname) + 4 (name) = 10. 
###### So each part must be exact. 
###### For example, if the city is "Split", part b's first three letters could be "itX" (but need to make sure there's enough letters). 
###### Wait, Split is 5 letters. So indices 0:S, 1:p, 2:l, 3:i, 4:t. So the first three letters are S, p, l. 
###### The part b's first three can't be Spl. So possible letters could be i, t, or any other letters from the city, but not starting with the first three. 
###### So maybe pick three random letters from the city excluding the first three. 
###### But if the city is only three letters, then this becomes a problem. 
###### But according to the examples, cities like Bauru (5 letters), Split (5), Lviv (4). 
###### So cities with more than three letters. So perhaps the code can handle cities longer than three letters.

###### For the surname part, take three random letters. 
###### If surname is shorter, maybe loop or pad. 
###### But common surnames are usually longer. Same for the name part: four random letters.

###### Then, concatenate the first string (5 letters) and the second string (10 letters), with the second string's first letter capitalized. 
###### Also, the entire name field becomes "[Darth/Jedi Master] [FirstString] [SecondString]".

###### Another thing: the user provided examples, but they shouldn't be included. 
###### So need to make sure that the generated names don't match the examples.

###### Now, putting this all together. 
###### The user wants the entire list without truncation. 
###### So I need to generate all 100 entries, each line with the correct format. 
###### Since the user can't run code, I have to manually generate this, but as an AI, I can simulate the process.

## Potential challenges:

### - Ensuring unique IDs: 
###### Generate 100 unique numbers between 1-5000. 
###### Maybe shuffle a list of numbers from 1 to 5000 and pick the first 100, but need to be random. 
###### Alternatively, use a set to collect unique random numbers until 100 are gathered.

### - Name composition: 
###### For each nationality, have a list of names and surnames. 
###### For example, Brazilian names: João, Maria, etc., surnames: Silva, Souza. 
###### Then assign 10% of 100 (10 names) as Brazilian. 
###### Then 15% Argentinian (15 names), etc. 
###### Need to make sure that names and surnames are unique combinations. 
###### So for each nationality, pick unique first and last names.

### - Telephone numbers: 
###### Country-specific formats. 
###### For example, Brazil uses +55 (but the example uses 11-98765-4321, which is a local format without country code. 
###### So maybe follow the example: for Brazil, it's two digits (area code?), hyphen, 5 digits, hyphen, 4 digits. 
###### Argentina might be similar but different. 
###### Croatia: maybe 021-123-456. 
###### Ukraine: 032-123-4567. 
###### Need to define formats per country.

### - Cities: 
###### Each country has a list of cities. 
###### For example, Brazil: São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Bauru, etc. 
###### Argentina: Buenos Aires, Cordoba, etc.

### - STAR WARS transformation: 
###### For each entry, randomly select Darth or Jedi Master. 
###### Then process the name as per the rules. 
###### The original name is replaced by the constructed strings.

###### Wait, the original name is not used anymore. 
###### The STAR WARS transformation replaces the name field with the constructed parts. 
###### The example shows:

### Original: Fabio Canedo becomes Darth CanBu BruCndibof

###### So the original name is discarded, and the new name is generated based on the surname, city, etc.

### So for the STAR WARS part, the steps are:

#### 1. For each record in the original list, apply the transformation.

#### 2. Choose 'Darth' or 'Jedi Master' randomly.

#### 3. Take the surname from the original name (e.g., Canedo) -> first three letters 'Can'.

#### 4. Take two random letters from the city (e.g., Bauru). Let's say 'B' and 'u', so 'Bu'.

#### 5. First string is 'CanBu'.

#### 6. For the second string:

###### a. Take three letters from the city, not the first three. 
###### City is Bauru (letters B, a, u, r, u). 
###### First three are 'Bau'. 
###### So pick three letters not starting with 'Bau'. 
###### Maybe 'r', 'u', 'u'? Or any letters except the first three. 
###### Wait, the city is Bauru, so indexes 0:B,1:a,2:u,3:r,4:u. 
###### So possible letters are r and u. 
###### But need three letters. 
###### Hmm, maybe the city has to be longer? Or perhaps letters can repeat. 
###### The example given: city Bauru, second string starts with 'Bru' (but wait, the example's second string is 'BruCndibof'). 
###### Wait, in the example, the original city is Bauru. 
###### For part 8c, the second string's first three letters (from city) shouldn't be the first three of the city. 
###### In the example, the city's first three letters are 'Bau', and the second string starts with 'Bru' which is different. 
###### So 'Bru' comes from the city letters, but not the first three. 
###### So in Bauru, the letters are B, a, u, r, u. 
###### So possible letters after index 2: r and u. 
###### But how to get three letters? Maybe allow letters from the entire city, but excluding the first three. 
###### So from index 3 onwards. 
###### So for Bauru, indexes 3: r and 4:u. 
###### So if we need three letters, but only two are available after index 2, maybe allow repeats or take from the entire city but not the first three letters. 
###### Wait, the rule says "make sure the first 3 letters for second string don't be equal to first 3 letters from City". 
###### So the first three letters of the second string (from city part) should not match the first three letters of the city. 
###### So even if the city is longer, like 'Split' (S, p, l, i, t), the first three letters are 'Spl'. 
###### The second string's first three letters (from city) can be any three letters from the city, as long as they are not 'Spl'. 
###### So for 'Split', possible letters are 'i', 't', or any combination that's not 'Spl'. 
###### But to get three letters, maybe take letters from the city excluding the first three, but if the city is exactly three letters, this becomes a problem. 
###### But the examples have cities with more than three letters. 
###### Maybe the cities are all longer, or the code can handle shorter cities by not using them. 
###### But the user's examples include Bauru (5 letters), Split (5), Lviv (4). 
###### So perhaps cities are chosen to have at least four letters. 
###### Alternatively, the code can take letters from the entire city but ensure that the first three of the second string's city part are not the same as the city's first three.

###### So, for the second string's city part (3 letters), generate three letters from the city, ensuring that the sequence is not the same as the first three letters of the city. 
###### For example, if city is 'Bauru', first three letters are 'Bau'. 
###### The second string's city part can be 'uru', 'ruB', etc., as long as it's not 'Bau'.

###### Then, take three random letters from the surname, and four from the name. 
###### But the surname and name here refer to the original surname and name from the initial list. 
###### Wait, the initial list's name is like "Fabio Canedo" (name and surname). 
###### So for the transformation, we need to split the original name into first name and surname. 
###### For example, in "Fabio Canedo", the surname is "Canedo". 
###### So the first three letters are 'Can', which becomes part of the first string.

#### So steps for transformation:

##### 1. Split original name into first name and surname. 
###### For example, "Fabio Canedo" becomes first name "Fabio", surname "Canedo".

##### 2. Generate first string: first three letters of surname (Can) + two random letters from city (Bauru → maybe 'B' and 'u') → 'CanBu'.

##### 3. Generate second string:

###### a. Take three letters from city, not matching the first three letters of the city. 
###### For Bauru (Bau), possible letters could be 'r', 'u', or others. Let's say 'r', 'u', 'u' → 'ruu'.

###### b. Take three random letters from surname 'Canedo' → could be 'nde'.

###### c. Take four random letters from first name 'Fabio' → 'abio'.

###### d. Combine: 'ruu' + 'nde' + 'abio' → 'ruundebabio' (but needs to be 10 characters). 
###### Wait, 3+3+4=10, which works. 
###### Then capitalize the first letter of the second string. 
###### Wait, the second string is part of the name field. 
###### The example shows "BruCndibof" where the second string starts with 'Bru' (from city), then 'Cndi' (from surname?), then 'bof' (from name?). 
###### Wait, maybe the example's breakdown is different. 
###### Let's check:

### Example: 1234, Darth CanBu BruCndibof, Brazil, Bauru, 11-98765-4321, 4500.00

###### The first string is CanBu (from surname Canedo's first three letters 'Can' + two letters from city Bauru 'Bu').

###### Second string is BruCndibof. 
###### Breaking down: first three letters 'Bru' (from city, not 'Bau'), then 'Cndi' (from surname 'Canedo'?), then 'bof' (from name 'Fabio'? 'Fabio' has letters F, a, b, i, o. So four letters could be 'abio').

###### But the example's second string is 'BruCndibof' which is 10 characters: Bru (3) + Cndi (4?) Hmm, maybe the breakdown is different. 
###### Wait, the example's second string is 'BruCndibof' which is 10 letters:

###### B r u C n d i b o f → 10 letters. 
###### So perhaps the breakdown is 3 (city) + 3 (surname) +4 (name), totaling 10. 
###### So 3+3+4=10. 
###### So 'Bru' (city part), 'Cnd' (surname part), 'ibof' (name part). 
###### That makes sense.

###### So for the second string:

###### - 3 letters from city (not first three)

###### - 3 letters from surname

###### - 4 letters from name

###### Concatenated, then the first letter of the second string is capitalized. 
###### Wait, in the example, the second string is 'BruCndibof' where 'Bru' is the city part starting with uppercase? 
###### No, the entire second string's first letter is capitalized. 
###### Wait, the rule 8d says: "make the first letter from second string is capital letter". 
###### So the second string (which is the entire 10-character string) should start with a capital letter. 
###### But in the example, the second string is 'BruCndibof' where 'B' is capitalized. 
###### So yes, the first letter is uppercase. 
###### So regardless of where the letters come from, the first character of the second string must be uppercase.

###### So, putting it all together for each record:

### 1. Randomly choose 'Darth' or 'Jedi Master'.

### 2. Split original name into first name and surname.

### 3. Generate first string: first three letters of surname + two random letters from city (total 5 letters).

### 4. Generate second string:

#### a. Three letters from city, not the first three.

#### b. Three letters from surname.

#### c. Four letters from first name.

#### d. Concatenate these parts (3+3+4=10), capitalize the first letter.

### 5. Combine first and second strings with a space: "Darth CanBu BruCndibof".

###### Now, applying this transformation to all 100 records.

### Potential issues:

###### - Ensuring that in the second string's city part, the first three letters are not the same as the city's first three. 
###### For example, if the city is 'Bauru' (Bau), the second string's city part can't start with 'Bau'. 
###### So any three letters from 'Bauru' except the first three. So 'aur', 'uru', 'ruB', etc.

###### - Handling cases where the city has exactly three letters. 
###### But according to the examples, cities are longer. 
###### o maybe all cities in the list have more than three letters.

###### - Ensuring that when selecting random letters from the city for the second string's first three, they are not the same as the city's first three letters. 
###### This might require checking each generated trio to ensure it's different.

###### Another thing: the user wants the entire list, no code, just the CSV data. 
###### So as an assistant, I need to generate all 100 lines following these rules, without any truncation.

###### Testing this with a few entries to see if it works:

###### Take an original entry:

### ID: 897, Name: Fabio Canedo, Country: Brazil, City: Bauru, Tel: 14-85632-8585, Salary: 5236.56

#### After transformation:

###### Choose 'Darth' or 'Jedi Master' randomly. Let's say 'Darth'.

###### First string: first three letters of surname 'Canedo' → 'Can' + two letters from city 'Bauru' (could be 'Bu') → 'CanBu'.

###### Second string: three letters from city not starting with 'Bau'. 
###### City letters are B, A, U, R, U. So possible letters R, U. 
###### But need three letters. 
###### Maybe allow repeating letters. So 'RUU' (but need three). 
###### Then three letters from surname 'Canedo' → 'nde', four letters from name 'Fabio' → 'abio'. 
###### Combine: 'RUUndeabio' → total 10 letters. 
###### Capitalize first letter → 'RuuNdeabio'? Wait, the example uses 'BruCndibof', which has the first three as 'Bru', then 'Cndi', then 'bof'. 
###### So the surname part is three letters, perhaps 'Cnd' from 'Canedo', and the name part 'ibof' from 'Fabio' (letters i, b, o, f). 
###### So the second string would be 'BruCndibof'.

###### But how to ensure that the city part's three letters are not the same as the first three. 
###### In 'Bauru', the first three are 'Bau'. 
###### So the second string's city part can't be 'Bau', but could be 'aur', 'uru', 'ruB', etc. 
###### So in the example, 'Bru' is used. 
###### 'B' is the first letter of the city, but 'Bru' is different from 'Bau'. 
###### So that's acceptable.

###### Another example: city Split (S, p, l, i, t). 
###### First three letters 'Spl'. 
###### Second string's city part could be 'lit', 'ipt', 'itS', etc., as long as it's not 'Spl'.

### Now, generating 100 such entries. Each requires:

#### - Unique ID

#### - Transformed name with 'Darth' or 'Jedi Master'

#### - Correct country and city mapping

#### - Telephone format per country

#### - Salary as a number with two decimals

###### Given the complexity, I need to make sure each step is followed carefully. 
###### Also, the user emphasized no truncation, so all 100 entries must be present.

## Potential time constraints: This is a time-consuming process, but as an AI, I can generate this systematically.

###### First, generate the initial 100 entries with the original names, countries, cities, etc. 
###### Then apply the STAR WARS transformation to each.

###### But the user wants the final list after the transformation. 
###### Wait, the initial list is the first step, then the STAR WARS change is applied to that list. 
###### So the final CSV is the transformed list.

###### Wait, the instructions say:

###### "After generated the first list, follow up the next rules, you will know this transformation as a STAR WARS change."

### So the process is:

#### 1. Generate the initial list (without STAR WARS), but then apply the transformation to that list to create the final list. 
###### So the final list is the transformed version of the initial list.

###### But the user says: "i want to generated a content for a csv file, follow this rules:..." and then the STAR WARS change is part of the rules. 
###### So the final CSV is the transformed list, not the original. 
###### The example given in item 8 is the transformed version. 
###### So the user wants the transformed list as the output.

###### Therefore, I need to generate the transformed list directly, not the original plus transformed. 
###### Because the STAR WARS change is part of the rules for generating the CSV.

###### Wait, re-reading the instructions:

###### Step 7 says: "After generated the first list, follow up the next rules, you will know this transformation as a STAR WARS change."

### So the process is:

##### - First, create the initial list according to rules 1-7.

##### - Then, apply the STAR WARS transformation (rules 8-9) to each entry in that list.

##### - The final list is the transformed one.

###### But the user wants the output to be the transformed list. 
###### However, the initial list is needed to apply the transformation. 
###### But the user doesn't want the initial list; they want the transformed list. 
###### Because the examples in item 8 show the transformed entries.

###### But the user says: "i want to generated a content for a csv file, follow this rules:..." which includes the STAR WARS change. 
###### So perhaps the entire process is to generate the transformed list directly, without showing the initial list. 
###### But how? Because the transformation depends on the initial list's data (surname, city, etc.).

###### Alternatively, the assistant must generate the initial list internally, apply the transformation, and output the transformed list. 
###### The user doesn't need the initial list, only the transformed one.

###### Yes, that makes sense. 
###### So the assistant has to first generate the initial 100 entries (following rules 1-7), then apply the STAR WARS transformation (rules 8-9) to each entry, resulting in the final 100 entries which are the ones to be output.

###### Therefore, the final CSV will have the transformed entries, not the original ones. 
###### The examples given in item 8 are part of the transformed list.

### Now, putting it all together:

#### 1. Generate 100 unique IDs between 1-5000.

#### 2. For each ID, assign a name according to the nationality percentages, ensuring no repeated names or surnames.

#### 3. Assign country and city based on the name's nationality.

#### 4. Generate telephone number based on country's format.

#### 5. Assign a random salary.

#### 6. Apply STAR WARS transformation to each entry:

###### a. Randomly choose 'Darth' or 'Jedi Master'.

###### b. Generate first string from surname and city.

###### c. Generate second string from city (excluding first three letters), surname, and name.

###### d. Capitalize the first letter of the second string.

#### 7. Combine everything into the final CSV.

#### Now, considering the percentages for nationalities:

###### - 10% Brazilian: 10 names

###### - 15% Argentinian: 15

###### - 5% Croatian: 5

###### - 10% Ukrainian: 10

###### - 5% British:5

###### - 5% German:5

#### Remaining 50% is split as:

###### 5% Chinese:5

###### 15% Indian:15

###### 10% Mexican:10

###### 10% Vietnamese:10

###### 10% Japanese:10

###### Total: 10+15+5+10+5+5 +5+15+10+10+10= 100.

###### So need to have name pools for each nationality.

###### But the assistant has to manually generate these names, ensuring they are common and not repeated.

###### This is quite involved, but as an AI, I can simulate this by using common names for each nationality.

##### For example:

###### Brazilian names: João, Pedro, Maria, Ana, etc.

###### Surnames: Silva, Santos, Oliveira, Souza, etc.

###### Argentinian names: Carlos, Juan, Sofia, Martina, etc.

###### Surnames: González, Rodríguez, Fernández, López, etc.

###### Croatian names: Ivan, Marko, Ana, Petra, etc.

###### Surnames: Horvat, Kovačević, Babić, etc.

###### Ukrainian names: Oleksandr, Andriy, Olena, Natalia, etc.

###### Surnames: Shevchenko, Kovalenko, Boyko, etc.

###### British names: James, Emily, Oliver, Charlotte, etc.

###### Surnames: Smith, Jones, Taylor, Brown, etc.

###### German names: Michael, Thomas, Anna, Julia, etc.

###### Surnames: Müller, Schmidt, Schneider, etc.

###### Chinese names: Wei, Jing, Li, Zhang, etc.

###### Surnames: Wang, Li, Zhang, Liu, etc.

###### Indian names: Aarav, Aanya, Rohan, Priya, etc.

###### Surnames: Patel, Singh, Kumar, Sharma, etc.

###### Mexican names: Santiago, Diego, Camila, Valeria, etc.

###### Surnames: Hernández, García, Martínez, etc.

###### Vietnamese names: Minh, Anh, Lan, Hùng, etc.

###### Surnames: Nguyễn, Trần, Lê, Phạm, etc.

###### Japanese names: Haruto, Yuto, Sakura, Yui, etc.

###### Surnames: Sato, Suzuki, Takahashi, Tanaka, etc.

###### Now, for each nationality, pick the required number of unique name-surname combinations.

###### For example, Brazilian: 10 entries. So 10 unique first names and 10 unique surnames, combined uniquely.

###### Same for others.

###### Once the initial list is generated, apply the transformation.

#### Now, the telephone numbers:

###### - Brazil: two-digit area code (like 11, 21), then 8 digits split as 5-4. E.g., 11-98765-4321.

###### - Argentina: maybe similar, 11-1234-5678?

###### But in the example, the Argentinian example isn't given. The user's example for Brazil uses 14-85632-8585, which is 2 digits, hyphen, 5 digits, hyphen, 4 digits. So total 11 digits including hyphens.

###### Croatia's example: 021-123-456 (area code 021, then 6 digits split as 3-3).

###### Ukraine: 032-123-4567 (3 digits area code, then 7 digits split as 3-4).

###### So per country, the telephone format varies.

##### For each country, define the telephone format:

###### - Brazil: ^\d{2}-\d{5}-\d{4}$

###### - Argentina: Maybe similar to Brazil? Or different. The user's example for Argentina isn't provided, so I'll assume a format like 011-1234-5678 (3 digits area code, hyphen, 4 digits, hyphen, 4 digits).

###### But need to check. Alternatively, the user's example for Croatia uses 021-123-456 (3-3-3), and Ukraine uses 032-123-4567 (3-3-4).

##### So per country:

###### - Brazil: 2 digits - 5 digits - 4 digits (total 11 numbers plus hyphens)

###### - Argentina: Maybe 3 digits area code, like 011-1234-5678

###### - Croatia: 021-123-456 (3-3-3)

###### - Ukraine: 032-123-4567 (3-3-4)

###### - UK: Maybe 020-1234-5678

###### - Germany: 089-123456 (3-6)

###### - China: 010-12345678 (3-8)

###### - India: 022-1234-5678

###### - Mexico: 55-1234-5678 (2-4-4)

###### - Vietnam: 024-123-4567 (3-3-4)

###### - Japan: 03-1234-5678 (2-4-4)

###### These are assumptions based on real formats, but the user's examples should guide. For example, the Brazilian example uses 14-85632-8585 (2-5-4), so follow that.

##### So telephone formats per country:

###### - Brazil: \d{2}-\d{5}-\d{4}

###### - Argentina: \d{3}-\d{4}-\d{4}

###### - Croatia: \d{3}-\d{3}-\d{3}

###### - Ukraine: \d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4}

###### - UK: \d{3}-\d{4}-\d{4}

###### - Germany: \d{3}-\d{6}

###### - China: \d{3}-\d{8}

###### - India: \d{3}-\d{4}-\d{4}

###### - Mexico: \d{2}-\d{4}-\d{4}

###### - Vietnam: \d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4}

###### - Japan: \d{2}-\d{4}-\d{4}

##### Now, generate these numbers randomly for each entry.

###### Salary: random between, say, 2000.00 to 10000.00, with two decimal places.

###### Now, applying all this, the assistant has to generate 100 entries, each with transformed names according to the STAR WARS rules.

###### This is a lot to handle manually, but as an AI, I can structure this systematically.

###### Let's proceed to generate the list step by step.

###### First, generate the 100 unique IDs. 
###### Let's say I use a set to collect random numbers between 1-5000 until I have 100 unique ones. 
###### For example: 1234, 3798, 2325, etc.

###### Then, for each ID, assign a nationality based on the percentages. 
###### For example, the first 10 entries are Brazilian, next 15 Argentinian, etc.

###### For each nationality, pick a name and surname from the respective pool, ensuring no repeats.

###### Assign a city from the country's city list.

###### Generate telephone number according to the country's format.

###### Generate a random salary.

### Then apply the STAR WARS transformation:

###### For each entry:

#### 1. Choose 'Darth' or 'Jedi Master' randomly (50% chance each? Or any proportion, as long as it's random).

#### 2. Split the original name into first name and surname.

#### 3. Generate first string:

###### a. Take first three letters of surname.

###### b. Take two random letters from city (could be any letters, including repeats).

#### 4. Generate second string:

###### a. Take three letters from city, not starting with the first three letters of the city.

###### b. Take three letters from surname.

###### c. Take four letters from first name.

###### d. Concatenate these, capitalize the first letter.

#### Finally, construct the name field as "[Prefix] [FirstString] [SecondString]".

###### Now, applying this to each of the 100 entries.

###### Since this is a detailed process, the assistant must ensure accuracy in each step, especially the transformation rules.

### Potential mistakes to avoid:

###### - Repeating IDs: Ensure all 100 IDs are unique.

###### - Repeating names in the initial list: Each name-surname combination must be unique.

###### - Correct country-city mapping: e.g., Brazilian names must have Brazil as country and a Brazilian city.

###### - Telephone formats must match the country.

###### - STAR WARS transformation must correctly follow the string construction rules, especially the second string's city part not matching the city's first three letters.

###### - Capitalization of the second string's first letter.

###### - Ensuring that the final list doesn't include the user's examples.

### Given the complexity, the assistant must proceed methodically, perhaps generating one entry at a time, ensuring all rules are followed, then compiling all 100.

###### But given the time constraints, the assistant will need to generate this efficiently, possibly using a simulated approach with placeholders for names and cities, then applying the transformation.

###### Finally, output the entire list without any truncation, as per rule 12.


## Understanding Confirmation:

###### Fields: id, name, country, city, telephone, salary.

###### ID: Unique random number (1-5000), no repeats.

###### Name: Unique combinations of common names/surnames per nationality ratios.

#### Nationality Distribution:

###### 10% Brazilian (10 names)

###### 15% Argentinian (15)

###### 5% Croatian (5)

###### 10% Ukrainian (10)

###### 5% British (5)

###### 5% German (5)

###### 5% Chinese (5)

###### 15% Indian (15)

###### 10% Mexican (10)

###### 10% Vietnamese (10)

###### 10% Japanese (10)

### STAR WARS Transformation:

###### Prefix: "Darth" or "Jedi Master".

###### First String: 3 surname letters + 2 city letters (5 total).

###### Second String: 3 non-first city letters + 3 surname letters + 4 name letters (10 total), first letter capitalized.

###### Output: 100 unique transformed records, no examples reused, full list provided.


#### Notes:

###### All IDs are unique and between 1-5000.

###### Names follow nationality ratios with unique combinations.

###### STAR WARS transformations adhere to substring rules (e.g., no first 3 city letters in second string).

###### Telephone formats match country standards.

###### Salaries vary between − 2000−10,000.
